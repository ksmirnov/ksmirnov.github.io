There shouldn't be a blog entry like this and I'll definitely consider to create a page for this, but let it be as is for now...

OK, what's this all about? It's just a commands cheat sheet for Unix based operation systems. Mostly for `macOS`.

Getting OS name and version:
{% highlight bash %}
cat /etc/*-release
{% endhighlight %}
